### CypressBootloader

CypressBootloader is based on MCUBoot library and intended to be used with Cypress PSoC64 Secure Boot enabled chips. It is mandatory application on each PSoC64 device.

**Description:**

Features implemented:
* Run on CM0p core
* Has debug prints to terminal on 115200
* Can validate image hash of 2 slots in flash memory BOOT and UPGRADE
* Starts image located in BOOT slot after validating signature
* Performs upgrade operation from UPGRADE slot to BOOT slot after UPGRADE image hash verification
* Supports Multi-Image processing

**Example flash map used for CypressBootloader on PSOC_064_2M in multi image configuration:**

    0x101D 0000 - 0x101D FE00 - CypressBootloader
    0x1000 0000 - 0x1001 0000 - BOOT slot of CypressBootloader
    0x1001 0000 - 0x1002 0000 - UPGRADE slot of CypressBootloader

All flash maps of slots are defined by policy. Default policies for supported targets can be found in `cysecuretools` package, used with CypressBootloader.

**Currently supported platfroms:**

* PSOC_064_2M
* PSOC_064_1M
* PSOC_064_512K

**How to build CypressBootloader:**

Root directory for build is **boot/cypress**.

The following command will build CypressBootloader HEX file:

    make app APP_NAME=CypressBootloader PLATFORM=PSOC_064_2M

Flags by defalt:

    BUILDCFG=Debug
    MAKEINFO=0
    
**Multi-Image Operation**

Multi-image operation considers upgrading and verification of more then one image on the device.

To enable multi-image operation `MCUBOOT_IMAGE_NUMBER` (mcuboot_config.h file) should be set to 2 (only dual-image is supported at the moment).

In multi-image operation (two images are considered for simplicity) CypressBootloader operates as following:

* Verifies Primary_1 and Primary_2 images;
* Verifies Secondary_1 and Secondary_2 images;
* Upgrades Secondary to Primary if valid images found;
* Boots image from Primary_1 slot only;
* Boots Primary_1 only if both - Primary_1 and Primary_2 are present and valid;

This ensures two dependent applications can be accepted by device only in case both images are valid.

**Default Flash map for Multi-Image operation:**

`0x101D0000 - 0x101DFE00` - CypressBootloader (PSoC-064 2M device is suggested here)

`0x10000000 - 0x10010000` - Primary_1 (BOOT) slot of Bootloader

`0x10010000 - 0x10020000` - Secondary_1 (UPGRADE) slot of Bootloader

`0x10020000 - 0x10030000` - Primary_2 (BOOT) slot of Bootloader

`0x10030000 - 0x10040000` - Secondary_2 (UPGRADE) slot of Bootloader

`0x10040000 - 0x10040100` - Scratch of Bootloader

These values are set as default in policies provided by `cysecuretools`.

**Multi-image policy**

To initiate CypressBootloader in multi-image mode, appropriate policy has to be used when provisioning device.

Those are supplied with [cysecuretools](https://pypi.org/project/cysecuretools/).

There are two firmware sections have to be present for each image and each has to contain "multi_image" : 1 or "multi_image" : 2 depending on which image is master.

If it is expected to use single-image only, then there should be regular polciy used with one firmware section in JSON and NO "multi_image" field has to be present.

**How to program CypressBootloader:**

CypressBootloader is programmed to the target board at provisioning stage. Refer to [PSoC® 64 Secure MCU Secure Boot SDK User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/psoc-64-secure-mcu-secure-boot-sdk-user-guide)

**Example terminal output:**
